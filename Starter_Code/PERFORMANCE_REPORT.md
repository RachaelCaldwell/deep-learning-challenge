# Deep Learning Model Performance Report for Alphabet Soup
***Overview of the Analysis*** <br>
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of two deep learning models created for Alphabet Soup, a non-profit organization. The goal is to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded, based on various features from their applications. This classification problem can help the organization allocate resources more effectively to increase the success rate of their funding initiatives.

# Results
***Data Preprocessing***<br>
*Target Variable:*
- The target variable for both models is "IS_SUCCESSFUL," which represents the success (1) or failure (0) of funding an applicant.
*Features:*
- The features used for the models include all columns in the dataset except "EIN" and "NAME," which are non-beneficial ID columns. These features are used to predict the success of funding.
*Removed Variables:*
- In the initial model, some categorical variables were transformed into dummy variables for model input. In the optimization model, the "EIN" column was dropped, and the "NAME" column was binned and replaced with a "Other" category.

***Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model***
*Initial Model:*
- Number of Input Features: 43
- Number of Hidden Layers: 2
- Number of Neurons in Hidden Layers: 80 (Layer 1) and 30 (Layer 2)
- Activation Function: ReLU for hidden layers and Sigmoid for the output layer
- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- The initial model was trained with 100 epochs, achieving an accuracy of approximately 72.42%.

*Optimization Model:*
- Number of Input Features: 43
- Number of Hidden Layers: 3
- Number of Neurons in Hidden Layers: 7 (Layer 1), 14 (Layer 2), and 21 (Layer 3)
- Activation Function: ReLU for hidden layers and Sigmoid for the output layer
- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- The optimization model was trained with 100 epochs, achieving an accuracy of approximately 77.92%.

***Summary***
The initial deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 72.42%, which falls short of the target model performance. To improve model performance, the optimization model was created by increasing the number of hidden layers and neurons. This optimization resulted in a higher accuracy of 77.92%.
